#Gothenburg City tour

A tour of the city on tramwayrails and water

**Project Information**

This is a site where you can book a unik and different tourtrip. 
The pictures are of landmarks so that the visitor knows that they are getting what they came for.
So that there dosent have to be big sections of text.
The site is clean and easy to  use and to find the information you need.
Making it easy for senior tourist to find the information they need, at the 
same time its minimalistic and clean for the younger tourist.

**Images**

I have used images from [pixabay.com](http://www.pixabay.com)
they are free images witout copyright

**Wireframes**

For this project I have used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to get a rough sketch  
off my project on a mobilefirst basis. 

As it is a rough sketch i have not decided were the name "Gothenburg city tour" goes.
When the images and text is in place i will try to find the best spot. 
Changes made from the original design will be documented under changes wireframes.
